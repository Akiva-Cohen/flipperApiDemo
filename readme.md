A WIP reference of flipper zero developer apis, specifically around the gui.
Contains a demo of and info about all gui modules.

Roadmap:
1. upgrade the demos to use more features
2. add settings to let users controll features of the demo (partly done);
3. Add support for widgets
4. add other apis (notification maybe?)
